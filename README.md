# RAG Data Preprocessing & Embedding Pipeline

This project provides a robust pipeline for preparing and embedding text data for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other NLP tasks. It includes data cleanup, chunking, embedding using the `nomic-embed-text` model from Ollama, and advanced retrieval mechanisms.

---

## Features
- **Data Cleanup:** Remove HTML, normalize text, strip unwanted characters, and more.
- **Chunking:** Split large documents into overlapping chunks for better context retention.
- **Embedding:** Generate high-quality vector embeddings using Ollama's `nomic-embed-text` model.
- **Similarity Search:** Find the most relevant text chunks for a given query.
- **Advanced RAG Techniques:** Includes query transformations, routing, indexing, agentic RAG, and more.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IDEAS-Incubator/LLM_Bootcamp_ADVANCED_RAG
   ```
2. **Create conda env (Python 3.11 or 3.12 recommended)**
   ```bash
   conda create -n adrag python=3.12
   conda activate adrag
   ```
   **Note:** Some packages may have compatibility issues with Python 3.13+. If you encounter installation errors, try using Python 3.11 or 3.12.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Set up your environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

### Example: Generating Embeddings

Use the following code to generate embeddings for a text chunk using Ollama:
```python
import ollama
response = ollama.embeddings(model='nomic-embed-text', prompt="your text chunk here")
embedding = response['embedding']
```

---

### Example: Similarity Search
Use cosine similarity (e.g., with scikit-learn) to compare query embeddings to your chunk embeddings.
